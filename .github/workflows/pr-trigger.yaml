# PR Trigger Workflow
# This workflow runs from the main branch and calls the pr.yaml workflow
# This ensures that the workflow definition from main is always used, even for PRs from feature branches
#
# SECURITY NOTE:
# - Uses pull_request_target to run workflow from main branch (not PR branch)
# - This prevents malicious workflow modifications in untrusted PR branches
# - The called pr.yaml explicitly checks out the PR's code using github.event.pull_request.head.sha
# - Permissions are restricted to read-only access to repository contents
