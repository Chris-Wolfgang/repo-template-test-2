# Contributing to <Application Name>

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **<Application Name>**! We welcome contributions to help improve this project.

## How Can You Contribute?

You can contribute in several ways:
- Reporting bugs
- Suggesting enhancements
- Submitting pull requests for new features or bug fixes
- Improving documentation
- Writing or improving tests

Please note: Before coding anything please check with me first by entering an issue and getting approval for it. PRs are more likely to get merged if I have agreed to the changes.


## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it locally.
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes** and commit them with clear messages:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Describe your changes"
   ```
4. **Push your branch** to your fork:
   ```sh
   git push origin your-feature-name
   ```
5. **Open a pull request** describing your changes.

6. **PR Checks:**  
   Once you create a pull request (PR), several Continuous Integration (CI) steps will run automatically. These may include:
   - Building the project
   - Running automated tests
   - Checking code style and linting

   **It is important to make sure that all CI steps pass before your PR can be merged.**
   - If any CI step fails, please review the error messages and update your PR as needed.
   - Maintainers will review your PR once all checks have passed.

## Guidelines

- Write clear, concise commit messages.
